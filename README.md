# Candy Dispenser Simulation

This program simulates a candy dispenser using a stack data structure. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to interactively push, pop, and peek at candies in the dispenser.

## Features

- **Push**: Add a candy to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top candy from the stack.
- **Peek**: View the candy currently at the top of the stack without removing it.
- **Visual Representation**: A dynamic spring mechanism visually represents the candies in the dispenser.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
- A custom `Stack` class (assumed to be defined in `stack.py`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. If you don't have Tkinter installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
